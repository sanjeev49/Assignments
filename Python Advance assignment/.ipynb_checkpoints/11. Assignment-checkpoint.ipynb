    "Decorators essentially automate the prior example's manual name rebinding here. Just like with metaclasses, because the decorator returns the original class, instances are made from it, not from a wrapper object. In fact, instance creation is not intercepted at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case—adding methods to a class when it's created—the choice between metaclasses and decorators is somewhat arbitrary. Decorators can be used to manage both instances and classes, and they intersect with metaclasses in the second of these roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this really addresses only one operational mode of metaclasses. As we'll see, decorators correspond to metaclass__init_methods in this role, but metaclasses have additional customization hooks. As we'll also see, in addition to class initialization, metaclasses can perform arbitrary construction tasks that might be more difficult with decorators."

    "Moreover, although decorators can manage both instances and classes, the converse is not as direct—metaclasses are designed to manage classes, and applying them to managing instances is less straightforward. We'll explore this difference in code later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of this section's code has been abstract, but we'll flesh it out into a real working example later in this chapter. To fully understand how metaclasses work, though, we first need to get a clearer picture of their underlying model."
