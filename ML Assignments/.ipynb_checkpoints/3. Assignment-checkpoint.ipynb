    "- Contextual Limitation:- If we consider the area of natural language processing (NLP), text and speech information are the means to understand languages by NLP algorithms. They may learn letters, words, sentences or even the syntax, but where they fall back is the context of the language. Algorithms do not understand the context of the language used. A classic example for this would be the “Chinese room” argument given by philosopher John Searle, which says that computer programs or algorithms grasp the idea merely by ‘symbols’ rather than the context given.\n",

This is where it gets complicated. Most tech companies have privatised data and these data are the ones which are actually useful for ML applications. But, there comes the risk of the wrong usage of data, especially in critical areas such as medical research, health insurance etc.,"
