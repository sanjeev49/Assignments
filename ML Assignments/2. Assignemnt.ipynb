    "##### Image Recognition\n",
    "Image recognition is one of the most common uses of machine learning. There are many situations where you can classify the object as a digital image. For example, in the case of a black and white image, the intensity of each pixel is served as one of the measurements. In colored images, each pixel provides 3 measurements of intensities in three different colors – red, green and blue (RGB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be used for face detection in an image as well. There is a separate category for each person in a database of several people. Machine learning is also used for character recognition to discern handwritten as well as printed letters.  We can segment a piece of writing into smaller images, each containing a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Speech Recognition\n",
    "Speech recognition is the translation of spoken words into the text. It is also known as computer speech recognition or automatic speech recognition. Here, a software application can recognize the words spoken in an audio clip or file, and then subsequently convert the audio into a text file. The measurement in this application can be a set of numbers that represent the speech signal. We can also segment the speech signal by intensities in different time-frequency bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech recognition is used in the applications like voice user interface, voice searches and more. Voice user interfaces include voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control. It can also be used a simple data entry and the preparation of structured documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Medical diagnosis\n",
    "Machine learning can be used in the techniques and tools that can help in the diagnosis of diseases. It is used for the analysis of the clinical parameters and their combination for the prognosis example prediction of disease progression for the extraction of medical knowledge for the outcome research, for therapy planning and patient monitoring. These are the successful implementations of the machine learning methods. It can help in the integration of computer-based systems in the healthcare sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "A classification is a process of placing each individual under study in many classes. Classification helps to analyze the measurements of an object to identify the category to which that object belongs. To establish an efficient relation, analysts use data. For example, before a bank decides to distribute loans, it assesses the customers on their ability to pay loans. By considering the factors like customer’s earnings, savings, and financial history, we can do it. This information is taken from the past data on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prediction\n",
    "Machine learning can also be used in the prediction systems. Considering the loan example, to compute the probability of a fault, the system will need to classify the available data in groups. It is defined by a set of rules prescribed by the analysts. Once the classification is done, we can calculate the probability of the fault. These computations can compute across all the sectors for varied purposes. Making predictions is one of the best machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regression\n",
    "We can also implement machine learning in the regression as well. In regression, we can use the principle of machine learning to optimize the parameters. It can also be used to decrease the approximation error and calculate the closest possible outcome. We can also use the machine learning for the function optimization. We can also choose to alter the inputs in order to get the closest possible outcome."
